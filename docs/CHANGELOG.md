# Changelog

Notable completed work, most recent first. Update when a feature or fix ships —
see `CLAUDE.md` for the full doc-tracking rules.

## Unreleased

- Profile screen wired up end-to-end: view/edit body, goal, activity, targets;
  reachable from Settings and the dashboard. Recomputes BMR/TDEE/targets live
  via `SetupEngineService`, matches `PROFILE_AND_SETTINGS_PLAN.md`'s Option A
  (that plan is now retired — fully superseded by this).
- Calendar events + meal templates added to export/import (was DB-only before;
  scheduled events lived in SharedPreferences and were silently excluded).
- Export gained a real share sheet; import gained a file picker (previously
  paste-JSON-into-a-TextField only).
- Sleep streaks (consecutive nights meeting the sleep goal) added, surfaced on
  the Sleep page.
- Fixed a real DST bug in `AppDateUtils.startOfWeek`/`endOfWeek` — used
  `Duration`-based day arithmetic, which drifts across a clock change; now
  uses the DST-safe `DateTime(y, m, d±n)` pattern already used elsewhere.
- Added `Meal.loggedAt` — a real time-of-day field instead of guessing from
  `createdAt`/keyword matching. Meal editor has a Time (optional) field; the
  calendar prefers it when present.
- "Stop Sleep" affordance surfaced on the dashboard quick-action (reflects an
  active session instead of always reading "Sleep Timer").
- Added a "Delete data older than X" option (Settings → Data Management) for
  meals/workouts/sleep entries and one-off calendar events.
- Fixed 3 real WCAG AA contrast failures in the built-in theme palette (ocean/
  forest/sunset primary colors were 2.5–2.8:1 against white button text,
  below the 4.5:1 bar) — caught by a new `test/regression/theme_contrast_test.dart`
  that audits every built-in theme.
- Added golden tests for `HuePicker`/`SaturationBrightnessPicker` (guards the
  zero-width `CustomPaint` regression class — ISSUES.md #32).
- Added a widget-interaction test tier (`test/widget/`) — tap a widget in
  isolation, assert its callback fired.
- Added `test/regression/notification_scheduling_test.dart` — asserts a
  scheduled event reaches the OS pending-notification queue, without waiting
  on real delivery.
- Accessibility: every icon-only `IconButton` now has a `tooltip`.
- Verified (not removed) `BackgroundRefreshService` — trimmed one dead
  `invalidate()` call after tracing it had no watcher, kept the two that do.

## Earlier

### Performance pass

- **Removed 500ms polling.** Every collection (`meals`, `foods`,
  `mealTemplates`, `workouts`, `sleep`) now has a `StreamController` that
  mutators fire on insert/update/delete, instead of a 500ms polling timer.
  ~60–70% CPU-while-idle reduction; updates are now instant instead of
  delayed up to 500ms.
- **O(n) → O(1) lookups.** Added `Map<String, T>` id-caches (`_foodsById`,
  `_mealsById`, `_mealTemplatesById`, `_exercisesById`,
  `_workoutTemplatesById`, `_workoutSessionsById`, `_sleepEntriesById`)
  alongside the existing lists, kept in sync on every mutation. `getById()`
  calls that used to do a linear `firstWhere()` scan are now instant
  regardless of collection size.

(`OPTIMIZATION_PROGRESS.md`'s remaining open items — moved to `docs/ROADMAP.md`
Epic G, since they're still real and hadn't been tracked as roadmap items.)
